# Adk_copilot

An intelligent AI copilot and expert assistant for developers using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). Built with a sophisticated multi-agent architecture, Adk_copilot helps developers solve problems, generate code, and navigate the complexities of building applications with the Google ADK.

  <!-- It's highly recommended to create and upload an architecture diagram -->

## Overview

Adk_copilot is designed specifically for developers working with the Google Agent Development Kit. It combines the power of multiple specialized AI agents to provide comprehensive assistanceâ€”from troubleshooting deployment issues to generating complete, production-ready code examples. Whether you're stuck on a technical problem or need help building a new agent, Adk_copilot is your intelligent pair programming partner.

### Key Features

-   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** An Orchestrator agent manages a team of five specialist sub-agents, each with expertise in different aspects of ADK development.
-   **Intelligent Problem Solving:** Analyzes deployment issues, configuration problems, and technical errors with context-aware solutions.
-   **Advanced Code Generation:** Creates complete, annotated agent implementations, custom tools, and application architectures tailored to your specific requirements.
-   **RAG-Powered Knowledge Base:** Utilizes Vertex AI RAG to search a comprehensive, auto-generated knowledge base of the official Google ADK documentation.
-   **Historical Solutions Database:** Connects to a BigQuery database to find solutions from previously resolved developer issues, learning from past problems.
-   **Stateful, Multi-Turn Workflow:** Manages conversation state to ensure logical progression from problem identification to solution implementation.
-   **Interactive Development Process:** For complex requests, the system proposes an architecture or approach before generating code, improving accuracy and developer satisfaction.
-   **Automated Environment Setup:** A single script handles the creation of all necessary data, cloud storage, BigQuery tables, and the RAG corpus, making setup seamless.

> **Note on Knowledge Base Content:** The knowledge base used by this agent is generated by scraping the publicly available [Google ADK documentation website](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). All content rights belong to the original authors. This project uses the content for demonstration and educational purposes in accordance with fair use principles. The scraped data is provided as-is and may not be perfectly formatted or up-to-date.

## Agent Architecture

The system is orchestrated by a main `orchestrator_agent` which delegates tasks to the following specialists:

1.  **`ticket_analysis_agent`**: Analyzes the initial developer request and enriches it with structured data (urgency, category, complexity, summary).
2.  **`knowledge_retrieval_agent`**: Performs a semantic search against the official ADK documentation (ingested into a Vertex AI RAG Corpus) to find relevant guides, APIs, and best practices.
3.  **`db_retrieval_agent`**: Searches a BigQuery database of historical developer issues to find similar past problems and their resolutions.
4.  **`problem_solver_agent`**: Synthesizes all gathered context to provide detailed, step-by-step solutions for deployment, configuration, or development challenges.
5.  **`code_generator_agent`**: Generates complete, high-quality code examples, agents, and applications when developers need implementation assistance.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and all necessary data backends.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.11+
-   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management.
-   A Google Cloud Project with the AI Platform API enabled.
-   The [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and authenticated (`gcloud auth application-default login`).

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file. **This is a mandatory step.**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit the newly created `.env` file with your specific Google Cloud project details.

```dotenv
# .env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-gcp-project-id
RAG_CORPUS_NAME="" # This will be auto-populated by the setup script
BQ_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
BQ_DATASET_ID=adk_copilot_dataset
CRM_API_KEY="your-crm-api-key-here" # Optional, not used in core logic
```

**Note:** The `GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET` must be a globally unique name. Using your project ID as a prefix is a good practice to ensure uniqueness.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use Poetry to create a virtual environment and install all required Python packages.

```bash
poetry install
```

### 4. Run the Automated Environment Setup

This final step runs a shell script that automates the entire backend setup process. It generates mock data and configures your Google Cloud services (BigQuery and RAG).

First, make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup_environment.sh
```

Now, run the script:
```bash
./setup_environment.sh
```

This script will perform the following actions:
1.  **Scrape Docs:** Run `scripts/scrape_adk_docs.py` to build the `data/knowledge_base`.
2.  **Create Mock DB:** Run `scripts/create_mock_db.py` to generate `data/resolved_tickets.csv`.
3.  **Setup BigQuery:** Run `scripts/setup_bigquery.py` to create the dataset and table in your GCP project and upload the CSV data.
4.  **Setup RAG:** Run `scripts/setup_rag.py` to create a GCS bucket, upload the knowledge base, create a Vertex AI RAG Corpus, and **automatically write the new `RAG_CORPUS_NAME` back to your `.env` file.**

After this script completes, your entire backend and data infrastructure will be ready to use.

## Running the Agent

You can interact with the agent using the ADK's built-in web interface.

```bash
# Make sure you are in the project's virtual environment
# poetry shell

adk web
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and select the `adk_copilot` agent from the dropdown menu.

### Example Interactions

-   **Problem Solving:** "My deployment is failing with a 403 Permission Denied error when trying to deploy my agent to Vertex AI. I've checked my service account permissions but I'm still getting this error."
-   **Code Generation:** "Write me an agent that uses a custom tool to get the current weather and provides personalized clothing recommendations based on the forecast."
-   **Architecture Guidance:** "I need to build a multi-agent system that processes customer feedback. What's the best approach using ADK?"
-   **Debugging Help:** "My agent is running but the tools aren't being called correctly. Can you help me troubleshoot?"
