# ADK Copilot

An intelligent AI copilot and expert assistant for developers using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). Built with a sophisticated multi-agent architecture, Adk_copilot helps developers solve problems, generate code, and navigate the complexities of building applications with the Google ADK.

  <!-- It's highly recommended to create and upload an architecture diagram -->

## Overview

Adk_copilot is designed specifically for developers working with the Google Agent Development Kit. It combines the power of multiple specialized AI agents to provide comprehensive assistance—from troubleshooting deployment issues to generating complete, production-ready code examples. Whether you're stuck on a technical problem or need help building a new agent, Adk_copilot is your intelligent pair programming partner.

### Key Features

-   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** An Orchestrator agent manages a team of five specialist sub-agents, each with expertise in different aspects of ADK development.
-   **Intelligent Problem Solving:** Analyzes deployment issues, configuration problems, and technical errors with context-aware solutions.
-   **Advanced Code Generation:** Creates complete, annotated agent implementations, custom tools, and application architectures tailored to your specific requirements.
-   **RAG-Powered Knowledge Base:** Utilizes Vertex AI RAG to search a comprehensive, auto-generated knowledge base of the official Google ADK documentation.
-   **Historical Solutions Database:** Connects to a BigQuery database to find solutions from previously resolved developer issues, learning from past problems.
-   **Stateful, Multi-Turn Workflow:** Manages conversation state to ensure logical progression from problem identification to solution implementation.
-   **Interactive Development Process:** For complex requests, the system proposes an architecture or approach before generating code, improving accuracy and developer satisfaction.
-   **Automated Environment Setup:** A single script handles the creation of all necessary data, cloud storage, BigQuery tables, and the RAG corpus, making setup seamless.

> **Note on Knowledge Base Content:** The knowledge base used by this agent is generated by scraping the publicly available [Google ADK documentation website](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). All content rights belong to the original authors. This project uses the content for demonstration and educational purposes in accordance with fair use principles. The scraped data is provided as-is and may not be perfectly formatted or up-to-date.

## Agent Architecture

The system is orchestrated by a main `orchestrator_agent` which delegates tasks to the following specialists:

1.  **`ticket_analysis_agent`**: Analyzes the initial developer request and enriches it with structured data (urgency, category, complexity, summary).
2.  **`knowledge_retrieval_agent`**: Performs a semantic search against the official ADK documentation (ingested into a Vertex AI RAG Corpus) to find relevant guides, APIs, and best practices.
3.  **`db_retrieval_agent`**: Searches a BigQuery database of historical developer issues to find similar past problems and their resolutions.
4.  **`problem_solver_agent`**: Synthesizes all gathered context to provide detailed, step-by-step solutions for deployment, configuration, or development challenges.
5.  **`code_generator_agent`**: Generates complete, high-quality code examples, agents, and applications when developers need implementation assistance.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and all necessary data backends.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.11+
-   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management.
-   A Google Cloud Project with the AI Platform API enabled.
-   The [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and authenticated (`gcloud auth application-default login`).

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file. **This is a mandatory step.**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit the newly created `.env` file with your specific Google Cloud project details.

```dotenv
# .env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-gcp-project-id
RAG_CORPUS_NAME="" # This will be auto-populated by the setup script
BQ_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
BQ_DATASET_ID=adk_copilot_dataset
CRM_API_KEY="your-crm-api-key-here" # Optional, not used in core logic
```

**Note:** The `GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET` must be a globally unique name. Using your project ID as a prefix is a good practice to ensure uniqueness.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use Poetry to create a virtual environment and install all required Python packages.

```bash
poetry install
```

### 4. Run the Automated Environment Setup

This final step runs a shell script that automates the entire backend setup process. It generates mock data and configures your Google Cloud services (BigQuery and RAG).

First, make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup_environment.sh
```

Now, run the script:
```bash
./setup_environment.sh
```

This script will perform the following actions:
1.  **Scrape Docs:** Run `scripts/scrape_adk_docs.py` to build the `data/knowledge_base`.
2.  **Create Mock DB:** Run `scripts/create_mock_db.py` to generate `data/resolved_tickets.csv`.
3.  **Setup BigQuery:** Run `scripts/setup_bigquery.py` to create the dataset and table in your GCP project and upload the CSV data.
4.  **Setup RAG:** Run `scripts/setup_rag.py` to create a GCS bucket, upload the knowledge base, create a Vertex AI RAG Corpus, and **automatically write the new `RAG_CORPUS_NAME` back to your `.env` file.**

After this script completes, your entire backend and data infrastructure will be ready to use.

## Running the Agent

You can interact with the agent using the ADK's built-in web interface.

```bash
# Make sure you are in the project's virtual environment
# poetry shell

adk web
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and select the `adk_copilot` agent from the dropdown menu.

### Example Interactions

-   **Problem Solving:** "My deployment is failing with a 403 Permission Denied error when trying to deploy my agent to Vertex AI. I've checked my service account permissions but I'm still getting this error."
-   **Code Generation:** "Write me an agent that uses a custom tool to get the current weather and provides personalized clothing recommendations based on the forecast."
-   **Architecture Guidance:** "I need to build a multi-agent system that processes customer feedback. What's the best approach using ADK?"
-   **Debugging Help:** "My agent is running but the tools aren't being called correctly. Can you help me troubleshoot?"
