# How to Integrate with Our API

**Issue:** User needs help setting up API integration or troubleshooting API connection issues.

**Solution Steps:**

1. Navigate to your account dashboard and go to the "API Keys" section.
2. Generate a new API key by clicking "Create New Key" and give it a descriptive name.
3. Copy the API key and store it securely (it will only be shown once).
4. Review our API documentation at docs.example.com/api for endpoint details.
5. Test your connection using a simple GET request to our health check endpoint.
6. Implement proper error handling and rate limiting in your application.
7. Monitor your API usage in the dashboard to ensure you stay within limits.

**Authentication:**
* Include your API key in the Authorization header: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
* All requests must be made over HTTPS
* API keys can be regenerated if compromised
