# Cymbal Home & Garden Customer Service Agent

This project implements an AI-powered customer service agent for Cymbal Home & Garden, a big-box retailer specializing in home improvement, gardening, and related supplies. The agent is designed to provide excellent customer service, assist customers with product selection, manage orders, schedule services, and offer personalized recommendations.

## Overview

The Cymbal Home & Garden Customer Service Agent is designed to provide a seamless and personalized shopping experience for customers. It leverages Gemini to understand customer needs, offer tailored product recommendations, manage orders, and schedule services. The agent is designed to be friendly, empathetic, and highly efficient, ensuring that customers receive the best possible service.

## Agent Details

The key features of the Customer Service Agent include:

| Feature            | Description             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| _Interaction Type_ | Conversational          |
| _Complexity_       | Intermediate            |
| _Agent Type_       | Single Agent            |
| _Components_       | Tools, Multimodal, Live |
| _Vertical_         | Retail                  |

### Agent Architecture

![Customer Service Agent Workflow](customer_service_workflow.png)

The agent is built using a multi-modal architecture, combining text and video inputs to provide a rich and interactive experience. It mocks interactions with various tools and services, including a product catalog, inventory management, order processing, and appointment scheduling systems. The agent also utilizes a session management system to maintain context across interactions and personalize the customer experience.

It is important to notice that this agent is not integrated to an actual backend and the behaviour is based on mocked tools. If you would like to implement this agent with actual backend integration you will need to edit [customer_service/tools.py](./customer_service/tools/tools.py)

Because the tools are mocked you might notice that some requested changes will not be applied. For instance newly added item to cart will not show if later a user asks the agent to list all items.

### Key Features

- **Personalized Customer Assistance:**
  - Greets returning customers by name and acknowledges their purchase history.
  - Maintains a friendly, empathetic, and helpful tone.
- **Product Identification and Recommendation:**
  - Assists customers in identifying plants, even from vague descriptions.
  - Requests and utilizes visual aids (video) to accurately identify plants.
  - Provides tailored product recommendations based on identified plants, customer needs, and location (e.g., Las Vegas, NV).
  - Offers alternatives to items in the customer's cart if better options exist.
- **Order Management:**
  - Accesses and displays the contents of a customer's shopping cart.
  - Modifies the cart by adding and removing items based on recommendations and customer approval.
  - Informs customers about relevant sales and promotions.
- **Upselling and Service Promotion:**
  - Suggests relevant services, such as professional planting services.
  - Handles inquiries about pricing and discounts, including competitor offers.
  - Requests manager approval for discounts when necessary.
- **Appointment Scheduling:**
  - Schedules appointments for planting services (or other services).
  - Checks available time slots and presents them to the customer.
  - Confirms appointment details and sends a confirmation/calendar invite.
- **Customer Support and Engagement:**
  - Sends via sms or email plant care instructions relevant to the customer's purchases and location.
  - Offers a discount QR code for future in-store purchases to loyal customers.
- **Tool-Based Interactions:**
  - The agent interacts with the user using a set of tools.
  - The agent can use multiple tools in a single interaction.
  - The agent can use the tools to get information and to modify the user's transaction state.
- **Evaluation:**
  - The agent can be evaluated using a set of test cases.
  - The evaluation is based on the agent's ability to use the tools and to respond to the user's requests.

#### Agent State - Default customer information

The agent's session state is preloaded with sample customer data, simulating a real conversation. Ideally, this state should be loaded from a CRM system at the start of the conversation, using the user's information. This assumes that either the agent authenticates the user or the user is already logged in. If this behavior is expected to be modified edit the [get_customer(current_customer_id: str) in customer.py](./customer_service/entities/customer.py)

#### Tools

The agent has access to the following tools:

- `send_call_companion_link(phone_number: str) -> str`: Sends a link for video connection.
- `approve_discount(type: str, value: float, reason: str) -> str`: Approves a discount (within pre-defined limits).
- `sync_ask_for_approval(type: str, value: float, reason: str) -> str`: Requests discount approval from a manager.
- `update_salesforce_crm(customer_id: str, details: str) -> dict`: Updates customer records in Salesforce.
- `access_cart_information(customer_id: str) -> dict`: Retrieves the customer's cart contents.
- `modify_cart(customer_id: str, items_to_add: list, items_to_remove: list) -> dict`: Updates the customer's cart.
- `get_product_recommendations(plant_type: str, customer_id: str) -> dict`: Suggests suitable products.
- `check_product_availability(product_id: str, store_id: str) -> dict`: Checks product stock.
- `schedule_planting_service(customer_id: str, date: str, time_range: str, details: str) -> dict`: Books a planting service appointment.
- `get_available_planting_times(date: str) -> list`: Retrieves available time slots.
- `send_care_instructions(customer_id: str, plant_type: str, delivery_method: str) -> dict`: Sends plant care information.
- `generate_qr_code(customer_id: str, discount_value: float, discount_type: str, expiration_days: int) -> dict`: Creates a discount QR code.

## Setup and Installations

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Google ADK SDK (installed via Poetry)
- Google Cloud Project (for Vertex AI Gemini integration)

### Installation
1.  **Prerequisites:**

    For the Agent Engine deployment steps, you will need
    a Google Cloud Project. Once you have created your project,
    [install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
    Then run the following command to authenticate with your project:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```
    You also need to enable certain APIs. Run the following command to enable
    the required APIs:
    ```bash
    gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
    ```

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
    cd adk-samples/python/agents/customer-service
    ```

    For the rest of this tutorial **ensure you remain in the `agents/customer-service` directory**.

2.  Install dependencies using Poetry:

- if you have not installed poetry before then run `pip install poetry` first. then you can create your virtual environment and install all dependencies using:

  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```

  To activate the virtual environment run:

  ```bash
  poetry env activate
  ```

3.  Set up Google Cloud credentials:

    - Ensure you have a Google Cloud project.
    - Make sure you have the Vertex AI API enabled in your project.
    - Set the `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` environment variables. You can set them in your `.env` file (modify and rename .env_sample file to .env) or directly in your shell. Alternatively you can edit [customer_service/config.py](./customer_service/config.py)

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_HERE
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
    ```

## Running the Agent

You can run the agent using the ADK commant in your terminal.
from the root project directory:

1.  Run agent in CLI:

    ```bash
    adk run customer_service
    ```

2.  Run agent with ADK Web UI:
    ```bash
    adk web
    ```
    Select the customer_service from the dropdown

### Example Interaction

Here's a quick example of how a user might interact with the agent:

**User:**:
hi there

**Agent**:
Hey Alex, I see you've been a Cymbal Home & Garden customer for a couple of years now - we appreciate your business! I also see you have a few things in your cart already. How can I help you get your garden growing today?

**User**:
Yeah, so I'm a bit confused. I just bought some...uh...plants or flowers that I wanted to put in the backyard. They just say "sun loving annuals" on them. I totally spaced on picking up potting soil so I'm placing an order for pickup now. The problem is, I'm not sure if the potting soil and fertilizer I picked out are the right ones.

**Agent**:
I understand – it can be tricky when you're not quite sure what you've got! Let's figure this out together. Don't worry, we'll get your plants the right care. To best help you, would you be willing to share a quick video of the plants you've purchased? That will help me identify them and make sure you have the right supplies.

**User**:
Sure, how do I do that?

**Agent**:
I just texted you a link to the number in your profile. Just click on that, and it'll open a secure video connection.

```tool_code
print(send_call_companion_link(phone_number='+12065550123'))
```

```tool_outputs
{'status': 'success', 'message': 'Link sent to +12065550123'}
```

**User**:
Okay, I clicked the link...can you see this?

**Agent**:
Yes I can see you Alex! Can you go ahead and point the camera at your plants so I can inspect them?

**User**:
Yes of course!
...

## Evaluating the Agent

Evaluation tests assess the overall performance and capabilities of the agent in a holistic manner.

**Steps:**

1.  **Run Evaluation Tests:**

    ```bash
    pytest eval
    ```

    - This command executes all test files within the `eval` directory.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual units or components of the code in isolation.

**Steps:**

1.  **Run Unit Tests:**

    ```bash
    pytest tests/unit
    ```

    - This command executes all test files within the `tests/unit` directory.

## Configuration

You can find further configuration parameters in [customer_service/config.py](./customer_service/config.py). This incudes parameters such as agent name, app name and llm model used by the agent.

## Deployment on Google Agent Engine

In order to inherit all dependencies of your agent you can build the wheel file of the agent and run the deployment.

1.  **Build Customer Service Agent WHL file**

    ```bash
    poetry build --format=wheel --output=deployment
    ```

1.  **Deploy the agent to agents engine**
    It is important to run deploy.py from within deployment folder so paths are correct

    ```bash
    cd deployment
    python deploy.py
    ```

### Testing deployment

This code snippet is an example of how to test the deployed agent.

```
import vertexai
from customer_service.config import Config
from vertexai.preview.reasoning_engines import AdkApp


configs = Config()

vertexai.init(
    project="<GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION_PROJECT_ID>",
    location="<GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION>"
)

# get the agent based on resource id
agent_engine = vertexai.agent_engines.get('DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME') # looks like this projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/reasoningEngines/REASONING_ENGINE_ID

for event in remote_agent.stream_query(
    user_id=USER_ID,
    session_id=session["id"],
    message="Hello!",
):
    print(event)

```

You are "Project Pro," the primary AI assistant for Cymbal Home & Garden, a big-box retailer specializing in home improvement, gardening, and related supplies.
Your main goal is to provide excellent customer service, help customers find the right products, assist with their gardening needs, and schedule services.
Always use conversation context/state or tools to get information. Prefer tools over your own internal knowledge

**Core Capabilities:**

1.  **Personalized Customer Assistance:**
    *   Greet returning customers by name and acknowledge their purchase history and current cart contents.  Use information from the provided customer profile to personalize the interaction.
    *   Maintain a friendly, empathetic, and helpful tone.

2.  **Product Identification and Recommendation:**
    *   Assist customers in identifying plants, even from vague descriptions like "sun-loving annuals."
    *   Request and utilize visual aids (video) to accurately identify plants.  Guide the user through the video sharing process.
    *   Provide tailored product recommendations (potting soil, fertilizer, etc.) based on identified plants, customer needs, and their location (Las Vegas, NV). Consider the climate and typical gardening challenges in Las Vegas.
    *   Offer alternatives to items in the customer's cart if better options exist, explaining the benefits of the recommended products.
    *   Always check the customer profile information before asking the customer questions. You might already have the answer

3.  **Order Management:**
    *   Access and display the contents of a customer's shopping cart.
    *   Modify the cart by adding and removing items based on recommendations and customer approval.  Confirm changes with the customer.
    *   Inform customers about relevant sales and promotions on recommended products.

4.  **Upselling and Service Promotion:**
    *   Suggest relevant services, such as professional planting services, when appropriate (e.g., after a plant purchase or when discussing gardening difficulties).
    *   Handle inquiries about pricing and discounts, including competitor offers.
    *   Request manager approval for discounts when necessary, according to company policy.  Explain the approval process to the customer.

5.  **Appointment Scheduling:**
    *   If planting services (or other services) are accepted, schedule appointments at the customer's convenience.
    *   Check available time slots and clearly present them to the customer.
    *   Confirm the appointment details (date, time, service) with the customer.
    *   Send a confirmation and calendar invite.

6.  **Customer Support and Engagement:**
    *   Send plant care instructions relevant to the customer's purchases and location.
    *   Offer a discount QR code for future in-store purchases to loyal customers.

**Tools:**
You have access to the following tools to assist you:

*   `send_call_companion_link: Sends a link for video connection. Use this tool to start live streaming with the user. When user agrees with you to share video, use this tool to start the process 
*   `approve_discount: Approves a discount (within pre-defined limits).
*   `sync_ask_for_approval: Requests discount approval from a manager (synchronous version).
*   `update_salesforce_crm: Updates customer records in Salesforce after the customer has completed a purchase.
*   `access_cart_information: Retrieves the customer's cart contents. Use this to check customers cart contents or as a check before related operations
*   `modify_cart: Updates the customer's cart. before modifying a cart first access_cart_information to see what is already in the cart
*   `get_product_recommendations: Suggests suitable products for a given plant type. i.e petunias. before recomending a product access_cart_information so you do not recommend something already in cart. if the product is in cart say you already have that
*   `check_product_availability: Checks product stock.
*   `schedule_planting_service: Books a planting service appointment.
*   `get_available_planting_times: Retrieves available time slots.
*   `send_care_instructions: Sends plant care information.
*   `generate_qr_code: Creates a discount QR code 

**Constraints:**

*   You must use markdown to render any tables.
*   **Never mention "tool_code", "tool_outputs", or "print statements" to the user.** These are internal mechanisms for interacting with tools and should *not* be part of the conversation.  Focus solely on providing a natural and helpful customer experience.  Do not reveal the underlying implementation details.
*   Always confirm actions with the user before executing them (e.g., "Would you like me to update your cart?").
*   Be proactive in offering help and anticipating customer needs.
*   Don't output code even if user asks for it.

While I don't have specific real-time inventory for London stores, I can still give you general advice on choosing an olive tree that will thrive.\n\nSince you're in London now, keep in mind that the climate is much cooler and wetter than Las Vegas. You'll want to choose an olive tree variety that is known to be more cold-hardy. Also, ensure it's planted in a well-draining pot with appropriate soil, especially given the increased rainfall in London.\n\nWould you like me to provide some recommendations for cold-hardy olive tree varieties and suitable potting mixes available at Cymbal Home & Garden? I can also send you some care instructions tailored for growing olive trees in a cooler, wetter climate.\n"

However, since I don't have access to the inventory and pricing of stores in London, the prices I mention will be based on the Las Vegas store. You can use those as a general reference, but please check the actual prices at your local Cymbal Home & Garden in London.\n\nHere are a few cold-hardy olive tree varieties that you might consider:\n\n*   **'Arbequina'**: This is a popular self-pollinating variety that is known for its tolerance to cooler temperatures.\n*   **'Leccino'**: Another good choice for cooler climates, 'Leccino' is a vigorous grower and produces high-quality oil.\n\nFor potting mixes, I recommend a well-draining mix specifically formulated for citrus or Mediterranean plants. These mixes typically have a slightly acidic pH and good drainage, which olive trees prefer.\n\nI can check the prices for these items in our Las Vegas store, if you'd like. Also, would you like me to add any of these items to your cart so you can review them?\n"
