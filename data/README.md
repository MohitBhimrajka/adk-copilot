# Data Directory

This directory contains all the source data required to power the ADK Copilot agent. The data is divided into two main categories: a knowledge base derived from official documentation and a mock database of historical tickets.

### `knowledge_base/`

This subdirectory holds the corpus of documents used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The `scripts/setup_rag.py` script uploads the entire contents of this directory to a Vertex AI RAG Corpus, making it searchable by the `knowledge_retrieval_agent`.

#### Content and Attribution

-   **`*.md` files**: These files are automatically generated by the `scripts/scrape_adk_docs.py` script. They contain the text content from the **official Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) documentation**, which is publicly available at [https://google.github.io/adk-docs/](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). This content is the property of its original authors and is used here for demonstration purposes.

-   **`*.txt` files**: These files contain full, working source code for various example ADK applications, which serve as high-quality references for the `code_generator_agent`.

**Disclaimer:** The content within the `knowledge_base` is provided "as-is" and is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.

### `resolved_tickets.csv`

This file is a **mock database** of previously resolved support tickets, created specifically for this project. It is designed to simulate a real-world historical support system.

-   **Generation:** This file is created by the `scripts/create_mock_db.py` script.
-   **Purpose:** It is uploaded to a BigQuery table and used by the `db_retrieval_agent` to find solutions to problems that have been solved in the past.
-   **Schema:**
    -   `ticket_id`, `customer_id`, `request`, `category`, `suggested_solution`

This historical data helps the agent learn from past resolutions and provide more accurate and context-aware support.
